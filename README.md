# Résumé

## Description
Master copy of my résumé (also known as a C.V. or curriculum vitae).

✨ View the live résumé as hosted on my website: [peter.mosier.ca/resume](https://peter.mosier.ca/resume)

## Deployment

⚙️ This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy `index.html` to my WordPress website at peter.mosier.ca/resume. 

👍 This action is triggered every time the resume is updated/saved (i.e. changes "Committed").

✅ The following badge shows whether the last deploy worked as expected. Clicking the badge shows the full run history.
